# Overview

![PictureofApplication](/public/bun-and-games.png)

All Bun & Games is an online recipe book where you can create, store, modify, and view all your favorite recipes in one convenient location.

It is a fullstack application that uses MongoDB and Express for the backend, and React, JavaScript, and Axios for the frontend.

## Installation Details

In order to manipulate and program this application for yourself, feel free to fork and clone this repo. Afterwards, ensure that you copy and paste the .gitignore file if you lose it in the process, and `npm install` afterwards.

If you want to run your server, use `npm start`.

## Development Process

This idea at its base is not particularly exciting, but I believe it has a lot of potential, which is why I chose to tackle this project.

Because I was working with unfamiliar technology (React and MongoDB), I set out to create a very basic version 1, where you have authorization, and can create, edit, update, view, and delete your recipes. I managed to achieve that relatively quickly (within a couple days), and spent quite a lot of time on the styling. I wanted this to look like a professional and authentic website that people could use.

Overall, the project was actually pretty smooth-sailing. There were a few problems, but I was generally quite proud of my problem-solving skills and how I was able to figure out some of the solutions myself.

## Current Unsolved Bugs

There are a few issues I would like to fix, namely:
-   Adjusting some of the CSS to make it more mobile-friendly
-   Fixing and implementing the Favorite button functionality (The "favorite" button currently does nothing)
-   Finding a more intuitive and better-looking way to display recipe ingredients and instructions

## Features for Future Iterations

There are also quite a few things I would like to add for future iterations:
-   Updating the backend to create a Favorites functionality
-   Updating the backend to allow for a "tag" functionality
-   Allowing the user to add tag(s) to a recipe
-   Allowing the user to retrieve/filter by their favorited recipes or by tag
-   Allowing the user to dynamically add inputs for their ingredients, versus its current version (one large form textarea)
